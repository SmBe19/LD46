For my next paper, I will need to analyze genomes using algorithms other people developed the 60s but I have already written several papers about. As I implemented them in an inefficient manner, I will need additional compute power. I will be using your compute infrastructure in the next time. I offer $5000 in compensation.\nThanks again,$senderName"
